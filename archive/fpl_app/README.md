### Step 1: Set Up Your Project Directory

1. **Create a New Directory**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the location where you want to create your project.
   - Create a new directory for your project:
     ```bash
     mkdir fpl_app
     cd fpl_app
     ```

2. **Open the Directory in VS Code**:
   - Open Visual Studio Code.
   - Click on `File` > `Open Folder...` and select the `fpl_app` directory you just created.

### Step 2: Create the Basic File Structure

1. **Create the Following Files**:
   - In the `fpl_app` directory, create the following files:
     - `app.py` (main application file)
     - `ui_components.py` (for UI components)
     - `tabs.py` (for tab management)
     - `requirements.txt` (for dependencies)
     - `README.md` (optional, for project documentation)

### Step 3: Install Required Packages

1. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```plaintext
   streamlit
   pandas
   requests
   ```
   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 4: Implement the Application Logic

1. **Edit `app.py`**:
   This file will serve as the main entry point for your Streamlit application.
   ```python
   import streamlit as st
   from tabs import render_my_team_tab, render_news_tab, render_team_recommendations_tab, render_scout_picks_tab

   def main():
       st.title("Fantasy Premier League Assistant")

       # Create tabs
       tab_names = ["My Team", "News", "Team Recommendations", "Scout Picks"]
       selected_tab = st.sidebar.selectbox("Select a tab", tab_names)

       if selected_tab == "My Team":
           render_my_team_tab()
       elif selected_tab == "News":
           render_news_tab()
       elif selected_tab == "Team Recommendations":
           render_team_recommendations_tab()
       elif selected_tab == "Scout Picks":
           render_scout_picks_tab()

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       main()
   ```

2. **Edit `tabs.py`**:
   This file will contain the functions to render each tab.
   ```python
   import streamlit as st

   def render_my_team_tab():
       st.header("My Team")
       st.write("Display your Fantasy Premier League team here.")

   def render_news_tab():
       st.header("News")
       st.write("Latest news related to Fantasy Premier League.")

   def render_team_recommendations_tab():
       st.header("Team Recommendations")
       st.write("Recommendations for your Fantasy Premier League team.")

   def render_scout_picks_tab():
       st.header("Scout Picks")
       st.write("Scout picks for the upcoming gameweek.")
   ```

### Step 5: Run Your Application

1. **Run the Streamlit Application**:
   In your terminal, run:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Open the Application**:
   After running the command, Streamlit will provide a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`) where you can view your application in a web browser.

### Step 6: Customize and Expand

- You can now customize each tab's content by adding more functionality, such as fetching data from APIs, displaying player statistics, or integrating other features relevant to Fantasy Premier League.

### Conclusion

You have successfully created a basic Streamlit application with tabs for "My Team," "News," "Team Recommendations," and "Scout Picks." You can expand upon this foundation by adding more features and improving the UI as needed.
