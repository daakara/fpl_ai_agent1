            **Fixture Difficulty Rating (FDR)** is a crucial tool for FPL success that helps you identify:
            
            üéØ **Core Concepts:**
            - **Easy Fixtures**: Target players from teams facing weaker opponents
            - **Difficult Fixtures**: Consider transferring out players facing strong teams
            - **Home vs Away**: Home advantage typically makes fixtures easier
            - **Form Impact**: Recent team performance affects fixture difficulty
            
            üìä **How to Use This Analysis:**
            - **Green (1-2)**: Excellent fixtures - Strong targets for transfers IN
            - **Yellow (3)**: Average fixtures - Neutral, monitor closely  
            - **Red (4-5)**: Difficult fixtures - Consider transfers OUT
            
            üéÆ **Strategic Applications:**
            - **Transfer Planning**: Target players from teams with upcoming easy fixtures
            - **Captain Selection**: Choose captains facing the weakest opponents
            - **Squad Rotation**: Plan bench players around difficult fixture periods
